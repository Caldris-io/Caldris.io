# Operational Layer — De Stijl Simulation

A Mondrian-inspired interactive visualization of an “operational layer” for agentic AI.  
Built with simplicity, modularity, and clarity in mind.

## 🌟 Features

- **3D animated grid** of operational “layers,” inspired by De Stijl geometric abstraction
- **Live metrics dashboard** (Topology, Load Balance, Active Agents, Throughput) — ready for real telemetry
- **Subtle interactive effects**: color pulses, mouse-driven perspective, animated status

## 🚀 How It Works

- Squares represent agents or system nodes.  
- Four stacked layers visualize multi-dimensional coordination.
- Metrics panel displays simulated system stats (telemetry hooks ready).
- Minimal UI — every element is intentional, no wasted noise.

## 🖥️ How to View

1. Clone or fork this repo.
2. Open `index.html` (or `Interactive_operational_layer.html`) directly in your browser.
3. Or, publish to GitHub Pages for a live, shareable demo.

## 🛠️ Customization

- Tweak grid size or colors in the CSS.
- Wire up the metrics panel to real data (Prometheus, New Relic, etc.) for production.
- All code is in a single HTML file — easy to modify, remix, or embed.

## 💡 Inspiration

This project combines **operational system thinking** with the clarity and beauty of De Stijl art.  
Every square, color, and metric means something.  
No clutter, just signal.
